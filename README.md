# 🧭 PathFinder Visualizer

A React-based interactive pathfinding algorithm visualizer.  Through a  visually appealing grid-based interface, see how several pathfinding algorithms, such as Dijkstra's, A*, DFS and BFS, operate in real-time.

## 📦 Features

- 🧠 Visualizes common pathfinding algorithms:
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm
  - A* (A-star)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
- 🧱 Create walls by clicking and dragging
- 📍 Drag-and-drop start and end nodes
- 🖥️ Fully responsive and interactive interface
